			<p>Welcome to my website, Good People. I love fashion, making things look fabulous, planning spectacular events, and cats.
			I really love cats. My hobbies include everything under the sun, I love having fun.</p>

		<div>
			<p>I hope to one day be a succesful event planner. I love celebrating and I love to help other people with their celebrations. 
			However, I have started eating ice cream for therapy, and if everything goes to pot, I would be happy just doing that, too.</p>
